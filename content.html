                                The real life signals that we  encounter in our day to day basis are mostly analog signals.
                                These signals are defined continuously in time and have infinite range of amplitude values.
                                In order to process these signals to obtain meaningful information, they need to be converted
                                to a format which is easily handled by computing resources like microprocessors, computers etc...
                                The first step in this process is to convert the real-time signal into discrete-time signals.
                                Discrete-time signals are defined only at a particular set of time instances. They can thus be
                                represented as sequence of numbers with continuous range of values.
                            </p>

                                The process of converting an analog signal (denoted as x(t)) to a digital signal (denoted as x(n))
                                is called the analog-to-digital conversion (referred to as digitization), usually performed by an
                                analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Here t is the continuous time variable and n is the sequence order.
                                In many applications after the processing of the digital signal is performed, x(n) needs to be 
                                converted back to analog signal x(t) before it is applied to appropriate analog device. 
                                This reverse process is called digital-to-analog conversion and is typically performed 
                                using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).

                                The process of digitization consists of first sampling (digitization in time)
                                and quantization (digitization in amplitude). In this experiment we will study 
                                and understand the principle of sampling, while the principle of quantization 
                                will be studied in the next experiment. The sampling process depicts an analog
                                signal as a sequence of values. The basic sampling function can be carried out 
                                with an ideal 'sample-and-hold' circuit which maintains the sampled signal until
                                next sample is taken. An ideal sampler can be considered as a switch that periodically
                                opens and closes every T seconds. The sampling frequency (fs in Hertz) is thus defined 
                                as</p>

                                so that the analog signal can be exactly reconstructed back from the discrete-time signal, 
                                the sampling frequency fs must be at least twice the maximum frequency component (fM)
                                of the original analog signal. Thus we have,<p style="text-align:center">`f_s>=2f_m  ....(2)`</p>
                            <p class="heading-content">The minimum sampling rate is called the Nyquist rate and the above Sampling Theorem is
                                called the Shannon's Sampling Theorem. When an analog signal is sampled at fs , 
                                frequency components higher than fs/2 fold back into the frequency range [0, fs/2].
                                This folded frequency components overlap with the original frequency components in the
                                same range and leads to an undesired effect known as aliasing. In this case, the original
                                analog signal cannot be recovered from the sample data. </p>
                            <p class="heading-content">Consider an analog signal of frequency 1Hz as shown in Fig. 3(a) below. The sampling 
                                frequency is 4Hz. The sampled signal is shown in Fig. 3(b), Note that an exact 
                                reconstruction of the missing samples is obtained so long as the Shannon's Sampling 
                                Theorem is satisfied.

                            <p class="heading-content">Now let's consider, the analog signal of frequency 5Hz as shown in Fig. 4(a) below.
                                The sampling frequency is same as above, i.e. 4Hz. The sampled signal is shown in
                                Fig. 4(b), Note that the reconstruction of the original analog signal is not possible 
                                since the sampling frequency does not satisfy Shannon's Sampling Theorem. In this case
                                the reconstructed signal has a frequency of 1Hz. The signal of 5Hz is folded back as 1Hz, 
                                into the range determined by the sampling frequency leading to the problem of aliasing.
